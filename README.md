This repository contains a Solidity smart contract with a bug that allows an attacker to transfer ownership to the zero address and thus lock the contract. The bug is in the _transferOwnership function which lacks a check for the zero address. The solution involves adding a check for the zero address to the function to prevent this from happening.  This is a common vulnerability in smart contracts.
